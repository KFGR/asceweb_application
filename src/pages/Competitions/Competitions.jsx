// At the end of the document, I am writing a new section to illustrate the two different ways to display images with react -Kelvin
/*Couple of errors noticed:
1. the tag <h8> is not a valid tag for modern browsers. You can use from h1 to h6, and create CSS classes to style them individually or style the tag directly, example:
Class creation:
 .h4-text{
  font-size: 8px;
  margin:0;
  padding:0;
    } 
    
Modifying the tag style (note this will modify every text with the tag <h4>
  h4{
    font-size: 8px;
    margin:0;
    padding:0;


2. Another thing to be aware of, In straight HTML CSS JS or VanillaJS, we use the term class, but in JSX format we use className.
    -You can do control+F to change the words from class to className.

3. These cards are all the same structure, focus on making a component card that has everything (image, button and information) and then reuse the component into different competitions.
    -Take a look to the ContentCard component that is under the folder of components.
    - The homepage has the component at the begining of the code.


4. For the buttons, make use of the component <button> because they are responsive and are easier to style.
      Example if you want to re-direct to another page: <a href="/home"><button type="button" className="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4 me-md-2 fw-bold">Join today</button></a>
      If the button performs an action on the same page, then the code has to be in javascript using {useState} inside the JSX document but before the return() statment of the function.
      Example:

      import React, { useState } from 'react';
      function button_open_modal() {
        const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false); -->do not show modal until an action

        const handleOpenModal = () => {
          setShowModal(true);
        };

        const handleCloseModal = () => {
          setShowModal(false);
        };

        return (
          <div>
            <button onClick={handleOpenModal}>Open Modal</button>
            {showModal && <Modal onClose={handleCloseModal} />}
          </div>
        );
      }

      export default ButtonWithModal;
